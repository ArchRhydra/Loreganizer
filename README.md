# Loreganizer
Repo for the "Loreganizer" lore organization application written with C# and WPF.
Users will be able to place graphs, text, timelines, maps, and more on an infinite blank canvas.
The purpose of this is primarily to facilitate either worldbuilding or analyzing the worldbuilding of a book, film, or game.

Currently, the application is in an early stage that only allows text boxes to be placed. Resizing, dragging, panning, zooming, and saving have been implemented.
Future versions will add a proper toolbar, colors, graphs, timelines, and more.
